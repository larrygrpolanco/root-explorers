# Feature Specification: Root Vagabond Portrait Creator

**Feature Branch**: `001-root-vagabond-portrait`  
**Created**: September 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Root Vagabond Portrait Creator: a simple web application for generating Root RPG vagabond portraits via a quiz and Gemini AI, as detailed in the full PRD above."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26

- Q: How should the app handle failures when calling the Gemini API (e.g., rate limits, network errors, invalid responses)? → A: Simple error message with retry button.
- Q: What validation or error handling should be applied to quiz inputs (e.g., empty name, invalid custom text)? → A: Basic required field checks with inline messages.
- Q: Should we add acceptance criteria to define completion for each feature (e.g., quiz submits without errors)? → A: Basic bullets under a new section.
- Q: How should the app handle duplicate character names in the gallery (e.g., allow multiples or prevent)? → A: Allow duplicates.
- Q: What accessibility features should be included (e.g., screen reader support)? → A: Basic ARIA labels and keyboard navigation; prioritize mobile-first UI.

### Session 2025-09-26-override

- Max length for custom fields: 200 characters.
- Edge cases: For empty custom inputs, default to first pre-written option; API error message: "Generation failed. Please try again." with retry; Corrupted gallery JSON: Reset to empty array on load.
- Performance: Quiz completion <2 minutes; Page load <3 seconds.
- Predefined lists: Species: Badger, Bird, Cat, Fox, Mouse, Owl, Rabbit, Raccoon, Squirrel, Wolf, Beaver, Opossum. Playbooks: Adventurer, Arbiter, Harrier, Ranger, Ronin, Scoundrel, Thief, Tinker, Vagrant. (See Requirements for explicit listing.)
- User types/permissions: All users (friends group) can view and save to shared gallery; no auth.
- Data retention: Indefinite storage in JSON file.
- Security: API key in .env; no client exposure.

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a player in the Root RPG, I want to create a unique full-body character portrait through a quick thematic quiz, so that I can enhance my role-playing experience with a visually appealing, game-style image generated by AI.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the user is on the landing page, **When** they select "Create a Vagabond", **Then** they are directed to the 3-step character quiz.
2. **Given** the user completes the quiz with selections or custom inputs, **When** they submit, **Then** the system generates and displays a character portrait based on the provided details.
3. **Given** the user views the results page, **When** they choose "Save", **Then** the character (name, playbook, portrait) is added to the gallery.
4. **Given** the user is on the landing page, **When** they select "View the Gallery", **Then** they see a grid/list of all saved characters with images, names, and playbooks.
5. **Given** the user edits the prompt on the results page, **When** they regenerate, **Then** a new portrait is generated and displayed based on the modified prompt.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user selects "Custom" but leaves the text input empty? (Default to first pre-written option.)
- How does the system handle API failures during image generation? (Display "Generation failed. Please try again." with retry option.)
- What if the gallery JSON file is corrupted or missing? (Reset to empty array on load.)

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a landing page with rustic woodland theme, offering "Create a Vagabond" and "View the Gallery" options.
- **FR-002**: System MUST guide users through a 3-step quiz: Step 1 for name, species (dropdown), playbook (dropdown); Step 2 for presentation, demeanor, item (radio options with custom text input); Step 3 for scene (radio with custom).
- **FR-003**: System MUST store user quiz choices in a state object (e.g., {name, species, playbook, presentation, demeanor, item, scene}) and pass it to the backend upon submission.
- **FR-004**: System MUST construct a dynamic prompt from the state object and call the Gemini API (with reference image) to generate the portrait.
- **FR-005**: System MUST display a loading indicator during image generation and show the portrait on the results page with "Save", "Edit" (pre-filled prompt textbox for regeneration), and "Try Again" (reset to quiz) options.
- **FR-006**: System MUST save selected characters (name, playbook, portrait URL/image) to a server-side JSON file upon "Save".
- **FR-007**: System MUST render the gallery as a responsive grid/list showing each character's image, name, and playbook; data loaded from the JSON file.
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure the UI is mobile-friendly with earthy color palette (browns, greens, oranges, creams), serif headings, sans-serif body text, and rustic textures (paper, wood grains).
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle custom inputs by incorporating user text directly into the prompt without validation beyond basic length checks (max 200 characters).
- **FR-010**: System MUST store the Gemini API key securely as an environment variable on the server, with no client-side exposure.
