When you make a player character for Root: The RPG, you
start by choosing a playbook. Each playbook is a kind of
character, a set of options for how you interact with and see the
Woodland. Some playbooks might be interested in getting into fights;
others like to talk their way out of conflicts. Some might be criminals
through and through; others might be up-and-coming heroes.
No playbook is a straitjacket. Each provides clear guidance to get
you started with your character, but there is space to define your
vagabond within the boundaries of the playbook. Furthermore, your
character can change, grow, and move beyond the initial constraints
of the playbook over the course of a campaign. You can even change
playbooks entirely, down the line, emphasizing a whole new way for
your character to approach the world.
Each PC uses a different playbook. That way, the band of vagabonds
consists of different, interesting characters who don’t overlap too much
in their abilities. Using different playbooks helps to ensure each PC
gets their own area to shine.
For more on the individual parts of the playbooks, make sure to check
out Chapter 4: Making Vagabonds starting on page 41.
The list of playbooks included in this chapter is:
·Adventurer - A charismatic, diplomatic vagabond, interested in
forging connections and maybe even changing the Woodland.
·Arbiter - A strong, battle-ready vagabond, acting often as defender
and interceding in unfair conflicts.
·Harrier - A fast, freelancing vagabond, specializing in smuggling and
speedy movement within and without clearings.
·Ranger - A forest-savvy, antisocial vagabond, quite skilled but more
a creature of the forests between clearings than of the clearings
themselves.
·Ronin - A highly trained outlander vagabond, cast forth from their
homeland and now masterless in the Woodland.
·Scoundrel - A destructive, risk-taking vagabond, with a heavy
inclination towards arson and over-the-top action.
·Thief - A skilled, criminal vagabond, expert in burglary and theft but
with a tendency to bite off more than they can chew.
·Tinker - An innovative, technically-competent vagabond, interested in
mechanisms, crafting, equipment, and dangerous new philosophies.
·Vagrant - A deceitful huckster vagabond, master of cons and trickery.

Sterling Reputation
Whenever you mark any amount of prestige with a faction, mark one
additional prestige. When you mark any amount of notoriety with a faction,
you can instead clear an equivalent amount of marked prestige.

Subduing Strikes
When you aim to subdue an enemy quickly and nonlethally, you can engage

harm if you do.

Talon on the Pulse
When you gather information about the goings-on in a clearing, roll with
Cunning. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7-9, ask 2.
• Who holds power in this clearing?

and they’ll do it for you. On a 10+, they really like you—they’ll share a valuable
secret or grant you a serious favor instead. On a miss, you read them totally

a special enmity? (mark one notoriety
for appropriate group)
Pleasant, persuasive, renowned, peaceful. The Adventurer is a speaker and
negotiator, trying to resolve conflicts and better the Woodland through honest
speech and genuine pleas.
As the Adventurer, you are a capable talker with a tendency towards
nonviolence and resolution of conflicts through negotiation. You might be
driven by a general tendency to help those in need, by the goal of rising in
renown, or by a specific desire to fix the larger Woodland—but one way or
another, you’re interested in being viewed positively.
Your fellow vagabonds will likely want to resolve things a bit more directly than
you, focusing on combat, thievery, or deception to get what they desire. But
in the long run, you are much more likely to achieve positive results; combat,
thievery, and deception tend to have consequences, even if you get away scot-
free in the moment.
Your natures, “Extrovert” and “Peacemaker,” both point at your penchant for
conversational interaction with other characters, your talent for relationship
building. Focus on your interactions with other characters, PCs and NPCs alike.
Look for chances to resolve situations by talking, without using violence, and
don’t shy away from risky situations. Your fellow vagabonds might have to come
in to bail you out, but that’s all for the best, making a more interesting game
and giving everyone a chance to shine. Use your other skills and connections
to support your fellow vagabonds if it does come to blows—if nothing else,
assessing the situation is always pretty useful.
Chapter 6: Playbooks 135
Notes on The Adventurer Moves
For Sterling Reputation, keep in mind that you only increase prestige gains by
one each time you gain prestige. This incentivizes pursuing lots of small good
deeds. Don’t hesitate to lose prestige so you can avoid gaining notoriety—racking
up notoriety can hurt your Reputation much more than losing a few prestige.
For Subduing Strikes, “aiming to subdue an enemy quickly and nonlethally”
often requires using an appropriate weapon. Coming at a foe with a sword
makes it difficult to try to subdue them nonlethally, even if you hit with the flat
of the blade. If your weapon inflicts exhaustion, then it is nonlethal.
For Talon on the Pulse, you need a bit of time to actually collect the
information. Think of the move as covering a short montage of you going
around the clearing and asking NPCs lots of different questions. On a miss,
you won’t necessarily be attacked or accosted, but drawing the interest of a
dangerous individual will complicate your life.
For Orator, you have to give your speech to “interested denizens of a clearing.”
The move won’t trigger if you try to speak to denizens who have no reason to
pay attention to what you say, and it won’t trigger if you’re speaking to non-
clearing denizens, like a group of bandits or a squad of well-trained soldiers.
“They will move to do it as they see fit” means that you don’t control exactly
how they follow your exhortations—the GM will describe what they do, based
on who they are and what choices you make from the list.
For Well-Read, keep in mind that moves like this are the only way to get +3 in a stat.
For Fast Friends, a “non-compromising question” is one they don’t feel
endangers them or threatens them in any way; a “simple favor” is one that
doesn’t cost them too much to conduct. A “valuable secret,” however, can
actually put them at risk for sharing it, and a “serious favor” might cost them
quite a bit in time, effort, or money—not so much that it’s self-destructive, but
enough that it actually puts them out.

Brute
Take +1 Might (max +3).

Carry a Big Stick
When you use words to pause an argument or violent conflict between
others, roll with Charm. On a hit, they choose: mark 2-exhaustion and
keep going, or stop for now. On a 10+, take +1 ongoing to dealing with them
peacefully. On a miss, NPCs turn their anger to you, and PCs take +1 ongoing
against you for the scene.

Crash and Smash
When you smash your way through scenery to reach someone or something,
roll with Might. On a hit, you reach your target. On a 10+, choose 1. On a 7–9,
choose 2.

• You break an important part of your surroundings
• You damage or leave behind a piece of gear (GM’s choice)
On a miss, you smash through, but you leave yourself totally vulnerable on the
other side.

Hardy
Take 1 additional injury box. Whenever time passes or you journey to a new
clearing, you can clear 2 injury boxes automatically.

Strong Draw
When you target someone with a bow, mark wear on the bow to roll
with Might. On a hit, mark exhaustion to inflict 1 additional injury. Mark
exhaustion again to make your shot ignore the enemy’s armor—they cannot
mark wear to absorb the injury.

Guardian
When you defend someone or something from an immediate NPC or
environmental threat, roll with Might. On a hit, you keep them safe and choose
one. On a 7–9, it costs: expose yourself to danger or escalate the situation.
• Draw the attention of the threat; they focus on you now
• Put the threat in a vulnerable spot; take +1 forward to counterstrike
• Push the threat back; you and your protectee have a chance to maneuver or flee
On a miss, you take the full brunt of the blow intended for your protectee, and
the threat has you where it wants you.

Which faction have you served
the most? (mark two prestige for

With which faction have you earned
a special enmity? (mark one notoriety
for appropriate group)
Just, mighty, committed, defensive. The Arbiter is a capable warrior and
protector, intervening in conflicts on one side or another, defending the
innocent and punishing the transgressors.
As the Arbiter, you are one of the most competent fighters among your
vagabond brethren, with a tendency to act like a wandering knight—a force of
martial prowess without a single specific cause, but with a sense of justice all
your own.
Other powers and figures are likely to want you on their side. After all, you
are one of the best warriors they could have fighting for them! A key question
for the Arbiter is always “On whose side do you fight?” Maybe you defend the
innocent from tyrants, but maybe you pick the side you think is most likely to
bring about peace.
Your natures, “Defender” and “Punisher,” speak to the two sides of the
Arbiter—one as a protector keeping harm from your wards, and the other as
an avenger pursuing justice against wrongdoers. Both of them are likely to
aim you at dangerous and powerful foes, so be on the lookout for antagonists
who are targeting other denizens (so you can protect them) or who are
deserving of justice.
Try to find causes to fight for or against. You’re skilled at fighting, but if you
only wait for fights to come to you, you might find yourself waiting more than
you’d like. And don’t hesitate to use other skills like Carry a Big Stick to try
to avoid fights—you’re skilled at fighting, but martial conflict almost always
creates new problems.
Chapter 6: Playbooks 139
Notes on The Arbiter Moves
For Carry a Big Stick, every party in the fight has to make the choice to mark
2-exhaustion and keep going or to stop for now. If one side keeps going and the
other stops, the side that keeps going has to mark 2-exhaustion but gets to make
the first move in the continued fight—after that, the side that chose to stop can
act as normal. “Stop for now” means that they have to stop fighting more or less
for the scene, but they can pick back up later. The “+1 ongoing to dealing with
them peacefully” also lasts only until the end of the scene (only lasting longer at
the GM’s discretion).
For Crash and Smash, you need a destination to trigger the move. “You break
an important part of your surroundings” means you break something you don’t
want broken—the GM will describe what that is. “You damage or leave behind
a piece of gear (GM’s choice)” means the GM chooses whether you damage the
gear or leave it behind—not both. The amount of damage (in wear marked) that
the equipment suffers is at the GM’s discretion based on where you are and what
you’re smashing through, although it defaults to 1-wear.
For Hardy, “journeying to a new clearing” includes both through paths and
through forest.
For Strong Draw, you must mark 2-exhaustion to ignore the enemy’s armor—
you cannot mark exhaustion just for the armor-piercing effect without the
additional 1-injury.
For Guardian, “defending someone” means that you are actively trying to keep
them from harm caused by an immediate danger—not hypothetical harm, not
harm in the future, but harm right now. “Draw the attention of the threat”
means that, as long as it’s a conscious threat, it’s now a danger more for you than
for your protectee. “Push the threat back” means that you create an opportunity
where you and your protectee are not in immediate danger and can try to
maneuver to safety.

Parkour
When you dash your way through a chaotic scene or fight, roll with Finesse.
On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. Spend your hold 1-for-1 to dash to something

nearby without being stopped. You can dash away from an enemy even at the

Traveler Extraordinaire
When you travel along the paths to another clearing, you can always give +1 to

to another clearing, you can always give +1 to the roll or clear 2-depletion, your
choice. In both cases, before you arrive at the next clearing, you can ask the GM
any two questions about the next clearing, based on what you remember from
your last time through.

Smuggler’s Path
You’ve got a good sense for finding secret paths and doors. When you spend
time looking for a secret way in or out of a place that might have one, mark
exhaustion and roll with Luck. On a hit, you find a hidden path—the GM will
detail it and to where it leads. On a 10+, there’s something along or inside the
path of value to you—the GM will tell you what. On a miss, you find a secret
path...and someone else is using it right this second. They probably won’t be
happy you found their secret.

Which faction have you served
the most? (mark two prestige for

With which faction have you earned
a special enmity? (mark one notoriety
for appropriate group)
Mobile, crafty, unbound, criminal. The Harrier is a moving, traveling vagabond,
often specializing as a freelancer for other powers. When they need something
smuggled in or out of a clearing, they’ll turn to the Harrier.
As the Harrier, you have a lot of useful skills, and you should seek opportunities
to apply them. You’re not as obvious a mercenary as a warrior like the Arbiter,
but plenty of black marketeers would love to have a Harrier on their payroll.
The Harrier is very effective at getting jobs and other tasks from NPCs, but is
just as effective at finding their own opportunities to take advantage of alongside
their fellow vagabonds. As the Harrier, don’t be afraid of trying to betray greater
powers for some gain or profit—it will often fit your drives perfectly.
Your natures, “Dutiful” and “Competitive,” both incentivize taking action—
doing over planning or thinking. Dutiful incentivizes taking on jobs on
behalf of others, so don’t hesitate to figure out what NPCs want and ask
them for work. Competitive incentivizes taking on risks—it’s easy enough to
hit Competitive in the middle of any job. Both of them shine a light on the
Harrier’s emphasis on constantly moving.
For the Harrier, your drives are even more crucial—if you’re ever looking for the
next big thing to do, look at your drives and focus on that. But you can easily
get by supporting other vagabonds in their goals, especially because it’s often
easy to hitch your drives and your nature to their objectives.
Chapter 6: Playbooks 143
Notes on The Harrier Moves
For Cross Country, the injury you mark represents pushing your body past its
limits. You cannot soak this injury with armor.
For Fleet of Foot and Hand, keep in mind that moves like this are the only way
to get +3 in a stat.
For Don’t Shoot the Messenger, remember that the Counterfeit roguish feat
granted by this move doesn’t count against your maximum total allowed
through advancement (six feats). You don’t have to have a counterfeit message
in your possession to “pretend to be an innocuous messenger.”
For Parkour, whatever hold you generate from the move, you may continue
to spend throughout the duration of the scene. Once the chaos is over, any
remaining hold is lost. You can spend your hold to move to places “within sight
and reach.” “Within sight” means you must either be able to see them or know
they are there; “within reach” means you must feasibly be able to reach them
within a few seconds of very fast, skilled movement. If you “dash away from an
enemy at the moment they attack,” you spend a hold and automatically shift
ranges, and their attack misses (unless they can still reach you).
For Traveler Extraordinaire, make the choice of adding +1 or clearing
2-exhaustion or 2-depletion before the roll, but after any other expenditures
you make—if the results of the move allow you to clear exhaustion or depletion,
you can clear the exhaustion or depletion you just marked for the roll. When
you ask two questions of the GM about the next clearing, the answers the GM
gives you only refer to what you can recall; things very well may have changed
since last you were there.
For Smuggler’s Path, you can only make the move in a place that might have
a secret path. The GM determines if the place might have a secret path; if it
couldn’t have a secret path, the GM tells you that and you don’t need to mark
exhaustion. On a miss, you still find the path and the GM will ultimately detail
it as a hit, but you have to deal with the other denizen inside it first.
