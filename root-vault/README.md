**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Product Team
**Date:** September 27, 2025

### 1. Overview & Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for the "Root Vagabond Portrait Creator," a web-based application designed for players of the *Root: The Roleplaying Game*. The application will guide users through a quick and engaging character creation quiz to generate a unique, high-quality portrait of their vagabond character in the distinct art style of the game. The primary goal is to provide a fun, creative tool that enhances the role-playing experience by helping users visualize their characters. The application will achieve this by translating user inputs from a carefully designed quiz into a detailed prompt for an AI image generation model.

### 2. Goals & Success Metrics

The project's success will be measured by the following goals and metrics:

| Goal | Metric |
| :--- | :--- |
| **High User Engagement** | - Average session duration of over 3 minutes. <br> - At least 50% of users who start the quiz complete it. |
| **Creative Satisfaction** | - A "like" or "dislike" button on the results page with a target of 80% "like" ratings. <br> - A gallery feature where users can voluntarily save their creations, with a target of 20% of generated portraits being saved. |
| **Ease of Use** | - Average time to complete the quiz under 5 minutes. <br> - A user satisfaction survey with a target score of 4 out of 5 or higher. |

### 3. User Personas

The primary target audience is players of *Root: The Roleplaying Game*, but it may also appeal to fans of the *Root* board game and the fantasy art aesthetic.

*   **The New Player:** Someone new to the Root RPG who wants a quick way to visualize their first character. They value simplicity and a guided experience.
*   **The Experienced Roleplayer:** A seasoned RPG player who has a specific character concept in mind and wants a tool to bring that vision to life. They appreciate creative control and the ability to input custom details.
*   **The "Root" Fan:** A fan of the board game's art and world who may not play the RPG but enjoys creating characters and art within that universe.

### 4. Functional Requirements

#### 4.1. The Character Creation Quiz

The core of the application is a multi-step quiz designed to be both quick and creatively inspiring. It will use a mix of multiple-choice questions for basic attributes and open-ended questions to gather descriptive details.

**Step 1: The Basics (Multiple Choice)**

This step establishes the foundational elements of the character.

*   **Species:** A selection of the core animal species from the Root RPG (e.g., Badger, Bird, Cat, Fox, Mouse, Owl, Rabbit, Raccoon, Squirrel, Wolf, Beaver, Opossum).
*   **Physical Attributes:**
    *   **Fur/Feather/Scale Color:** A palette of common colors.
    *   **Eye Color:** A selection of eye colors.
    *   **Build:** Options such as "Slight," "Average," or "Hefty."
    *   **Height:** Options like "Short," "Average," or "Tall" (relative to their species).

**Step 2: The Playbook (Visual Selection)**

Users will be presented with a series of beautifully designed "Playbook Cards." Each card will feature the official artwork for one of the nine vagabond playbooks: Adventurer, Arbiter, Harrier, Ranger, Ronin, Scoundrel, Thief, Tinker, and Vagrant. This provides a strong visual anchor for the user's choice.

**Step 3: The Spark of Life (Open-Ended Questions)**

This section is designed to elicit descriptive and imaginative responses from the user that will be directly used in the AI prompt. Each question will have a character limit to encourage concise yet descriptive answers.

*   **"What is their most defining physical feature?"** (e.g., "a long scar over their left eye," "a perpetually twitching ear," "a brightly colored, mismatched pair of socks").
*   **"Describe their typical expression or demeanor."** (e.g., "a cheerful grin," "a world-weary sigh," "eyes that are always scanning the horizon").
*   **"What is a treasured item they always carry?"** (e.g., "a worn leather-bound book," "a single, beautiful blue feather," "a set of well-used lockpicks").
*   **"What kind of clothing do they prefer?"** (e.g., "a patched-up traveler's cloak," "a fine, embroidered waistcoat," "sturdy leather armor").

#### 4.2. AI Image Generation

*   The system will use a predefined prompt template that incorporates the user's answers. This ensures stylistic consistency with the *Root* art style while allowing for unique character details.
*   A loading indicator will be displayed during image generation, with an estimated completion time.
*   The generated image will be a full-body portrait of the vagabond character.

**Prompt Template Example:**

> "Full body portrait of a [Build] [Height] [Species] vagabond. They have [Fur/Feather/Scale Color] fur and [Eye Color] eyes. Their most defining feature is [Answer to Q1]. Their typical expression is [Answer to Q2]. They are wearing [Answer to Q4] and carrying [Answer to Q3]. In the vibrant, storybook art style of Kyle Ferrin's Root board game, textured and expressive."

#### 4.3. Results and Gallery

*   The results page will display the generated portrait.
*   Users will have the option to "Save to Gallery," "Try Again" (which resets the quiz), or "Download Image."
*   The Gallery will be a publicly viewable collection of saved portraits, displayed in a simple grid format. No user accounts will be required.
